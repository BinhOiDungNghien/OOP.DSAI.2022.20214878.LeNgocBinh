We avoid using Getter and Setter because
- Java Beans can be built without getters and setters.
The introspection-based idiom is being improved in Java 1.5.

- Accessors are acceptable when methods return objects in terms of interfaces.

- Accessors complicate code and make maintenance more difficult.

- Getter and setter methods violate encapsulation.

- Getter and setter methods are not particular object-oriented.

- Numerous getter and setter methods can indicate poor design from an OO perspective.
